# Sales Prediction_Machine Learning project

The task at hand involves developing a machine learning model for sales forecasting at Rossmann, which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. The aim is to predict daily sales up to six weeks in advance, taking into consideration various factors that influence store sales, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and location.

To achieve this, historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores has been provided, with the objective of forecasting the "Sales" column for the test set. However, some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment. The goal is to build a predictive model that can generalize to new data and accurately forecast sales for Rossmann stores, accounting for differences in various countries and situations.
